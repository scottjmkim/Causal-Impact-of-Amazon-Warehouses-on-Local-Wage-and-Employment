    "# Causal Effect of Amazon Warehouses on Employment and Wage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Name: Scott Kim <br> Email: [scott.kim@stern.nyu.edu](scott.kim@stern.nyu.edu) \n",
    "\n",
    "** Summary and Background: ** <br> The aim of this project will be to estimate the causal effect of Amazon facilities on unemployment and wage. The inspiration for this project came from The Economist [article](https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21735020-worlds-largest-online-retailer-underpaying-its-employees-what-amazon-does-wages) that we read in class during this semester. This article detailed how once Amazon opened up a warehousing facility in Lexington County, South Carolina, total employment in the warehousing and storage industry increased sharply while wage unexpectedly dropped. While the infographic paints an interesting tale, a lot of variables weren't mentioned and thus left me with many questions. Did the total employment increase because Amazon brought with it employers from other states? Or did it increase because employees from other industries, or even similar industries, joined Amazon's warehouse? If it were either of these reasons, the benefit of Amazon's job creation seems to be a surface level effect. Perhaps unrelated to these reasons though, the boost in employment could have simply been a result from a general rising trend in employment throughout the state. We can even go further and ask whether a county being urban or rural has an impact on the net level of employment and wage received from Amazon Fulfilment Centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I currently don't have the resources to completely explore this issue, my research project hopes to explore these types of questions. It will first focus on identifying a similar effect for all of the counties that have been exposed to new Amazon warehouses. It is very possible that the type of trend we saw in Lexington County was specific only to Lexington County. Before I answer any of these more complicated questions mentioned before, this is one I plan to address first.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Data: ** <br> The data that I will use in this project comes from four main sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) ** [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/API/bea_web_service_api_user_guide.htm): ** The data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis will be the foundation for this project. With it, I am able to access the total employment and compensation of workers across counties and years from 2001 to 2014 within the transportation and warehousing industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two TableNames and their respective keys that I've used in this project are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* CA25N - Total Full-Time and Part-Time Employment by NAICS Industry\n",
    "* CA6N - Compensation of Employees by NAICS Industry\n",
    "* Key 800 - Private nonfarm employment: Transportation and warehousing (NAICS:48-49)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) ** [MWPVL International](http://www.mwpvl.com/html/amazon_com.html): ** MWPVL International is a specialized supply chain, logistics, and distribution firm that has compiled a data set on Amazon's warehouses. This data set details the size in square feet, location, type, and the year opened of all the warehouses. With this data, I'm able to locate which counties were treated with Amazon warehouses in which year, and thus am able to identify the before and after effects of these facilities across all affected counties. However, the website is protected and will not allow me to copy the data. Because of this consideration, I have decided to use only the data on * The Amazon Fulfillment Center and Distribution Center Network in the United States * within this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) ** [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/data/): ** The data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics share similar attributes to the data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. With it, I am able to access the total employment and compensation of workers across counties and years until as recently as 2016. However, due to the manual labour this method of data extraction requires, I will use this data set only to replicate the figure seen in The Economist article. \n",
    "\n",
    "The keys and specifications for the manipulation of these data sets are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ENU45063105493 - Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages --> 493 NAICS 493 Warehousing and storage --> 45063 Lexington County, South Carolina --> Private --> All Employees --> All establishment sizes\n",
    "* ENU45063405493 - Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages --> 493 NAICS 493 Warehousing and storage --> 45063 Lexington County, South Carolina --> Private --> Average Weekly Wage --> All establishment sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "4) ** [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/demo/metro-micro/delineation-files.html): ** The Census Bureau provides a list of all counties that are a metropolitan statistical area, or a micropolitan statistical area. Furthermore, they provide this data along with the FIPS county codes, which will make our lives easier later when merging our data. These classifications will be used later to see whether a county being urban has an impact on Amazon's choices to establish a fulfilment center, and the effects on employment and wage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these data sets, I eventually intend on conducting a two-way fixed effects regression to address time and county specific trends, as well as utilizing Cox Proportional-Hazards and Tobit models to account for counties that have been treated with several Amazon Fulfilment Centers. While running such analyses, I will scale the data to account for issues like the differences in county populations, as well as inflation for wage figures. I also plan on running F-tests to check whether there are any significant differences between different types of counties (urban, semi-urban, or rural) and types of fulfilment centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I wish to find appropriate instrumental variables to include in my regressions to address potential endogeneity issues. A possible idea for such an instrumental variable is identifying counties in which Amazon Fulfilment Centers were planned but cancelled for some unrelated reasons. Another option is to use the time lag between when plans for an Amazon Fulfilment Center is an announced and the time of official opening."

    "Now that we have another version of the Lexington County graph, we can start to compare some details and draw further conclusions. This new graph is using data from not just the *493 NAICS 493 Warehousing and storage* industry, but also from every other industry in the broad category of *Transportation and warehousing (NAICS:48-49)* as a consequence of the nature of the data sets available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, any change in employment will be a reflection of the entire related industry, and not just the specific industry of Warehousing and storage. Here we see from 2012 until 2014, there was roughly a 2800 increase in total employment in the *Transporation and warehousing* industry. From our previous graph, we see that there was just over a 3000 increase in total employment in just the *Warehousing and storage* industry alone. This is suggestive that there were very little employment coming into the *Warehousing and storage* industry from closely related industries, at least within Lexington County."

    "Unfortunately, the previous graph as it is only depicts the scenario for Lexington County, South Carolina only. This could be a misrepresentation of data, as Lexington County could be the only county to show such results. To gain a more holistic understanding of the causal impact of Amazon warehouses, we aim to find the average change in total employment and wages from 2 years before and after an Amazon warehouse is introduced in all counties.\n",

    "Using the data from MWPVL and the US Census Bureau, I was able to run a preliminary difference-in-differences analysis of the effects of Amazon Fulfilment Centers on employment levels within treated counties, with all counties as a control group. Within this analysis there were 92 counties as part of the treated group that were exposed to Amazon Fulfilment Centers. To run this analysis, I normalized the data of the total warehousing employment with the year prior to the opening of an Amazon Fulfilment Center as the base year. I chose this year because the majority of the employment from a fulfilment center occurs very shortly after its opening, and thus would be included in the opening year. I then averaged these normalized figures from two years before to two years after the treatment. For the control group, I used the same base years as the treated counties.\n",

    "Now this is very interesting! The figure shows a persuasive case that Amazon Fulfilment Centers do seem to have a causal impact on local employment. This is because while the employment levels of treated counties compared with all counties seem quite similar in the years preceding the opening of a fulfilment center, once the treatment happens treated counties exhibit strictly higher levels of employment. However, this effect may be an overestimate as counties that have been exposed to one fulfilment center are often treated by more than one in the following years. Therefore, I believe further analyses including the aforementioned regressions are necessary."

Here we see that on average, treated counties exhibited higher levels of wage than all counties in the years before the opening of an Amazon Fulfilment Center. However, this changes drastically after the opening of the center, with average wage levels falling far below that of all counties. This is in contrast to employment levels, which we saw increased after treatment."

    "### Conclusion and Future Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "So we've come a long way since the original graph of Lexington County, South Carolina. We were able to show that, on average, counties that were treated with Amazon warehouses exhibited positive levels of growth in total employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also showed that same was not true for average income. In fact we observed that counties treated with Amazon warehouses seemed to exhibit worse levels of income than the average county. This seems to be consistent with the initial findings of Lexington County, South Carolina.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this project is by no means a perfect analysis or proof that Amazon warehouses do indeed have a causal impact on economic variables such as employment and average income. To deal with issues such as omitted variable biases, more advanced econometric tools would be necessary. Here are the considerations going forward:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges with Empirical Analysis:**\n",
    "* The most obvious challenge I face is selection bias regarding the location of Amazon Fulfilment Centers. Obviously, Amazon was not randomly choosing counties when deciding to open fulfilment centers; they had specific goals and criteria in mind. If this bias is unaccounted for, I may very well end up observing positive preexistent trends since Amazon could have only chosen counties with upward trajectories in employment and wages (or possibly the opposite). I have proposed fixed effects regressions and potential instrumental variables to address this issue.\n",
    "* There are historic events unrelated to Amazon Fulfilment Centers that may have affected total employment and wages within the warehousing industry of counties. For example, the Great Recession in 2007 would have negatively impacted employment and wage levels. A fixed effects regression will help address this issue.\n",
    "* Counties vary widely across the United States in a number of variables. Perhaps the most significant is size. Some counties are very small, especially near the east coast, while some are extremely large near the west coast. To account for this issue, I can scale down county data by the respective county population.\n",
    "* Some counties have several Amazon Fulfilment Centers. This issue becomes more problematic when fulfilment centers open on dates very close to each other, as I may then be overestimating their effects. To address this, I can utilize a Cox Proportional-Hazards model.\n",
    "* When using the data on square feet of total Amazon Fulfilment centers per county, I may be overestimating its effect since the values for square feet cannot be negative. For this issue, I can implement a Tobit model.\n",
    "* Another significant obstacle is that an increase in employment in one county may simply be employment that has been displaced from other counties or industries. In this case, it is hard to definitively conclude whether Amazon has truly created employment or simply displaced labor from elsewhere.\n",

    "**Challenges with Data Collection:**\n",
    "* The current county-level data set from the BEA includes yearly data only. It would benefit the analyses if I can identify monthly data sources.\n",
    "* I need to establish a new way to indicate which counties are urban, semi-urban, and rural. Instead of using Metropolitan Statistical Areas, I may need to use population density instead.\n",
    "* The data concerning the proposed instrumental variables may not be available at all. In that case, I will need to do further research to obtain such data or find other possible instrumental variables of which the data is available.\n",

    "Nevertheless, the project displays a more holistic overview of what the causal impact of Amazon warehouses would look like than figure in The Economist article, which was the original goal of this project!"
