**Project Description** 

This project aims to identify the causal impact of Amazon warehouses on local employment and average 
income. It was inspired by The Economist article that was discussed in this class which showed that
total employment and average weekly wages in the warehousing and storage industry in Lexington County, 
South Carolina increased and decreased respectively upon the opening of an Amazon warehouse. This 
project takes this analysis even further by using data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis to 
retrieve economic variable figures down to the county level, and pairs them with Amazon warehouse
data from MWPVL International. This data is then used to average the change in total employment and
average income levels 2 years before and after an Amazon warehouse enters a given given. Other statistics
such as the interquartile range and growth rate are also calculated and shown. In summary, the project
found that Amazon warehouses seem to have positive impacts on the total employment, but negative effects on the average
income in the counties they enter.
